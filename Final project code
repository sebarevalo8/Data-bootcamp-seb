        "Airbnb is one of the biggest property rental services in the world, connecting millions of hosts and travelers globally. For my final project, I aim to develop a predictive model capable of accurately estimating the nightly prices of Airbnb listings and analyzing the trends and patterns that influence these prices. Nightly prices are a key metric for measuring a listing's profitability and appeal, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of the short-term rental market. I hope that my project is able to shed light on the most important characteristics.\n",

These predictions will allow stakeholders to make informed decisions, enhancing their overall experience and improving the platform's effectiveness in meeting user needs.\n",

This issue may have arisen due to an indirect correlation between latitude and realSum, or between latitude and other variables that the model overemphasized.

        "In my analysis of Airbnb pricing, the models I constructed demonstrated improved performance over the baseline predictor, with the Random Forest model emerging as the best. This model's ability to capture complex, non-linear interactions between features made it the most precise in predicting listing prices. The ensemble nature of Random Forest, which combines the predictions of multiple decision trees, allowed it to generalize well to unseen data, outperforming other models such as Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree Regression, and Multiple Linear Regression. Key predictors such as person_capacity and bedrooms consistently ranked as the most influential across all models, which aligns with logical assumptions that larger properties with more capacity typically command higher prices. Additionally, features like dist (distance from the city center) also showed strong importance, highlighting the significance of location in determining listing value. However, features like latitude and longitude were inconsistently ranked across models. For instance, Gradient Boosting and Random Forest assigned high importance to latitude, which may reflect indirect correlations rather than a meaningful relationship with price. This is true due to the fact that latitude is irrelevant without longitude to give you a precise point.\n",

        "Despite the success of the models, there is room for improvement in refining the features and expanding the dataset. Incorporating additional features such as seasonal pricing trends, including peak tourist seasons and holidays, could help the models capture temporal fluctuations in pricing. Moreover, integrating further guest reviews and host attributes, such as response times and hosting experience, could offer insights into the role of service quality on price. Adding detailed neighborhood data, such as safety ratings, walkability scores, and proximity to attractions, would help the models better differentiate pricing based on local desirability. Furthermore, including demand-related metrics, such as the number of available listings in the area or occupancy rates, could enhance the models’ ability to understand market dynamics and competition. Finally, something that I would like to add that would make the model more user-friendly would be a map with the longitude and latitude combined for easier visualization of listing location. This could be added not only as a quality-of-life update, but by combining longitude and latitude, we could actually give them value within the dataframe and the model.\n",

By expanding the scope of features and focusing on capturing both spatial and temporal attributes, the models could be refined to not only predict prices more accurately but also offer actionable recommendations for Airbnb hosts. This would enable hosts to strategically price their listings and maximize revenue while helping potential guests identify properties that provide the best value. Ultimately, such improvements would align with the original goal of using data analysis to better understand and optimize the Airbnb market.\n",
